<h1 align="center">About Automobile</h1>
<p align="center">

Automobile offers a rich and varied examination of the automotive universe in all its forms – delivered by our stable of first-class editors and freelance contributors and illustrated with vibrant photography. Our aim is to drive new cars in new and interesting ways and celebrate the automotive lifestyle and its personalities, past and present. We also deliver the latest automotive news and offer insights into emerging trends in the automotive industry, whatever the medium – be it magazine, digital, social, video, mobile, and whatever comes next.

The 2014 All-Stars cars and our editors, deep in the Louisiana Bayou.
Unlike most other car magazines, Automobile, which debuted in 1986 under the leadership of legendary automotive journalist David E. Davis, Jr. and was further nurtured by the indomitable Jean Jennings, does not regularly perform instrumented tests or obsess about the technical minutiae. Instead, the focus is on subjectively driven experiences with cars in their naturally intended, real-world habitats.
